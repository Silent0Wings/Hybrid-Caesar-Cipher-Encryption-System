# Hybrid Caesar Cipher Encryption System

## Overview

The Hybrid Caesar Cipher Encryption System is a Java-based encryption tool that enhances the classic Caesar cipher by incorporating multiple layers of security, including scrambling, shuffling, and dynamic shifting algorithms. This approach increases the complexity and security of the encryption process, making it much more difficult to decode without the correct key.

## Features

- **Enhanced Security**: Combines the Caesar cipher with additional layers of encryption, including scrambling and shuffling techniques.
- **Customizable Algorithms**: Users can select from various algorithms to tailor the encryption process to their needs.
- **Dynamic and Randomized Processes**: Introduces variability and randomization in the encryption steps, ensuring unique outputs for each encryption.
- **Reliable Decryption**: The system ensures that the original message can be accurately retrieved through the decryption process using the correct key.

## How It Works

1. **Input Message**: The user provides a plaintext message and a key.
2. **Encryption Process**: The message is encrypted through multiple stages, including shifting, scrambling, and shuffling, resulting in a highly secure encrypted output.
3. **Decryption**: The system can reverse the encryption process, accurately restoring the original message when provided with the correct key.
